# OpenVPN Client with Automatic Port Forwarding

This systemd service brings up an OpenVPN client connection on a server and automatically configures port forwarding
using iptables. When the service starts, other clients connected to the main OpenVPN server can access services running
on localhost of this server through the OpenVPN client's IP address.

## üéØ Use Case

You have an OpenVPN server running (like the one in this workspace), and you want to:

1. Connect a secondary server as an OpenVPN client
2. Automatically expose services from that server to other VPN clients
3. Enable/disable access on-demand by starting/stopping the service

## üìã Components

- **`openvpn-client-forwarding.service`** - Main systemd service file
- **`setup-port-forwarding.sh`** - Script that manages iptables rules
- **`openvpn-client-forwarding.env`** - Configuration file for ports and settings
- **`install-openvpn-client-forwarding.sh`** - Installation script

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **OpenVPN client package** installed on the target server:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install openvpn
   
   # CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install openvpn
   
   # Fedora
   sudo dnf install openvpn
   ```

2. **Generate a client certificate** from your OpenVPN server:
   ```bash
   # On your OpenVPN server (this workspace)
   ./manage-client.sh myclient-server add
   ```

3. **Transfer the .ovpn file** to your target server

### Install the Service

1. **Copy all files** to your target server:
   ```bash
   scp *.service *.sh *.env myclient-server.ovpn user@target-server:/tmp/
   ```

2. **Run the installation script** on the target server:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   sudo ./install-openvpn-client-forwarding.sh myclient-server.ovpn
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the configuration file to customize your setup:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/client/openvpn-client-forwarding.env
```

### Configuration Options

```bash
# OpenVPN Client Configuration
OPENVPN_CONFIG_PATH="/etc/openvpn/client/client.ovpn"
OPENVPN_CLIENT_NAME="client"

# VPN Network Configuration
VPN_INTERFACE="tun0"                    # VPN interface name
VPN_SERVER_NETWORK="10.8.0.0/24"      # Your VPN network range

# Ports to forward from localhost to VPN clients
# Format: LOCAL_PORT:PROTOCOL (tcp/udp)
FORWARD_PORTS="22:tcp 80:tcp 443:tcp 3000:tcp 8080:tcp"
```

### Example Port Configurations

```bash
# Web services only
FORWARD_PORTS="80:tcp 443:tcp"

# Development environment
FORWARD_PORTS="22:tcp 3000:tcp 8080:tcp 9000:tcp"

# Database and web services
FORWARD_PORTS="80:tcp 443:tcp 3306:tcp 5432:tcp"

# Gaming servers
FORWARD_PORTS="25565:tcp 7777:udp"
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Start the Service

```bash
sudo systemctl start openvpn-client-forwarding
```

### Check Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status openvpn-client-forwarding
```

### View Logs

```bash
sudo journalctl -u openvpn-client-forwarding -f
```

### Stop the Service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop openvpn-client-forwarding
```

### Enable Auto-start (Optional)

```bash
sudo systemctl enable openvpn-client-forwarding
```

## üåê How It Works

### 1. Service Startup Sequence

1. **Pre-flight Checks**: Validates configuration and OpenVPN files
2. **OpenVPN Client Start**: Connects to your OpenVPN server
3. **Interface Detection**: Waits for VPN interface (`tun0`) to be ready
4. **Port Forwarding Setup**: Configures iptables rules for specified ports
5. **Ready**: Service is running and ports are forwarded

### 2. Network Flow

```
VPN Client (10.8.0.2) ‚Üí OpenVPN Server ‚Üí Target Server (10.8.0.10)
                                              ‚Üì
                                          iptables DNAT
                                              ‚Üì
                                        localhost:port
```

### 3. Service Shutdown Sequence

1. **Cleanup Signal**: Removes iptables rules
2. **OpenVPN Stop**: Terminates OpenVPN client connection
3. **Final Cleanup**: Ensures all iptables rules are removed

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Check Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status openvpn-client-forwarding
```

### View Detailed Logs

```bash
sudo journalctl -u openvpn-client-forwarding -f --no-pager
```

### Test VPN Connection

```bash
# Check if VPN interface is up
ip addr show tun0

# Check VPN client IP
ip addr show tun0 | grep 'inet '
```

### Test Port Forwarding

```bash
# From another VPN client, test connection
nc -zv 10.8.0.10 22  # Replace with your target server's VPN IP and port
```

### Manual iptables Check

```bash
# View current iptables rules
sudo iptables -t nat -L OPENVPN_CLIENT_FORWARD -v
sudo iptables -L OPENVPN_CLIENT_ACCEPT -v
```

### Common Issues

1. **"VPN interface did not come up"**
    - Check OpenVPN client configuration
    - Verify server connectivity
    - Check firewall rules

2. **"Port forwarding not working"**
    - Verify service is running on localhost
    - Check iptables rules are applied
    - Test from another VPN client

3. **"Service fails to start"**
    - Check configuration file syntax
    - Verify OpenVPN client config exists
    - Check system logs

## üîí Security Considerations

- Service runs as root (required for VPN and iptables operations)
- Only VPN network clients can access forwarded ports
- Ports are forwarded to localhost only (not external interfaces)
- iptables rules are automatically cleaned up on service stop

## üìö Examples

### Example 1: Web Development Server

```bash
# Configuration
FORWARD_PORTS="22:tcp 3000:tcp 8080:tcp"

# Access from VPN client
ssh user@10.8.0.10                    # SSH to server
curl http://10.8.0.10:3000           # Access development server
curl http://10.8.0.10:8080           # Access alternative port
```

### Example 2: Database Server

```bash
# Configuration  
FORWARD_PORTS="3306:tcp 5432:tcp"

# Access from VPN client
mysql -h 10.8.0.10 -u user -p        # MySQL connection
psql -h 10.8.0.10 -U user dbname     # PostgreSQL connection
```

### Example 3: Production Web Services

```bash
# Configuration
FORWARD_PORTS="80:tcp 443:tcp"

# Access from VPN client
curl http://10.8.0.10                # HTTP access
curl https://10.8.0.10               # HTTPS access
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom iptables Rules

If you need custom iptables rules, modify the `setup-port-forwarding.sh` script:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/client/setup-port-forwarding.sh
```

### Multiple Services

You can run multiple instances with different configurations by:

1. Creating separate configuration files
2. Creating additional service files with different names
3. Using different client certificates

### Monitoring and Alerts

Add monitoring by creating systemd overrides:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit openvpn-client-forwarding
```

Add notification commands in the `[Service]` section.
